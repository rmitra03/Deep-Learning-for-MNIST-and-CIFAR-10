# Deep-Learning-for-MNIST-and-CIFAR-10
Uses multiplayer perceptrons (MLPs) and convoluional neural networks (CNNs) on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets and compares the results to determine which method works where.

To run the notebook file, simply access it through a medium like Google Colab, use a GPU (like NVIDIA L4), and run it, ensuring that the session doesn't time out.
